### The Story of Ramu and the Robot 🤖

# What is programming?

Ramu owned a small tea shop.
One day, he bought a robot to help him.

The robot was very strong, very fast…
but there was one problem:

**The robot could not think on its own.**

If Ramu said:

> “Make tea”

The robot would just stand there.

So Ramu realized something important:

> “This robot needs **clear, step-by-step instructions**.”

---

### Giving Instructions

Ramu said to the robot:

1. Take a cup
2. Add one spoon of tea leaves
3. Add sugar
4. Boil water
5. Pour water into the cup
6. Stir and serve

Now the robot worked perfectly.

Those instructions were **not English conversation**.
They were **precise, exact, and unambiguous**.

---

### That Is Programming

**Programming is the art of telling a machine exactly what to do, step by step.**

* The **robot** is the computer
* The **instructions** are the program
* The **language** Ramu uses (Java, Python, C, etc.) is a programming language

Computers are powerful, but they are **very literal**.
They do only what you tell them — nothing more, nothing less.

### Why Programming Exists

Imagine if every time Ramu had to:

* Calculate daily sales
* Track expenses
* Manage customers

He did it manually.

So instead, he **programs the robot once**, and the robot works every day without mistakes.

That’s why we use programming:

* To automate work
* To reduce human errors
* To make machines useful

### Real Life Example

When you:

* Order food on an app
* Send a message
* Withdraw money from an ATM

Behind the scenes, a programmer has written **clear instructions** for the computer to follow.

### One-Line Meaning (Remember This)

> **Programming is teaching a machine how to solve problems by giving it clear instructions in a language it understands.**
